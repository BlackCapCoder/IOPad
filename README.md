## Prelude

They say laziness is a quality in computer science, and I am lazy. I am so incredibly lazy that I cannot be bothered to move my hand from the keyboard to reach for the mouse. Thus, my quest began to free myself from the horrors of the mouse.

This has been very successful; I have spent a significant amount of time hacking window managers and web browsers and learning text editors, to the point where I longer use the mouse - I use the keyboard exclusively.

This was not good enough for me however, I still had to keep my hands on the keyboard and move my fingers and stuff- this would not do! How can I possibly get any lazier?

This is what I came up with: A glove with pressure sensors on the fingertips! I would apply a certain amount of pressure on each finger, and the combination would be a keystroke. Another option was to integrate it into a stress ball.

I figured that the learning curve would be a bit steep thought; I wanted a tactile version to start of with, and then I could probably transition into a glove fairly painlessly.

So I began constructing a keyboard with four switches on it. The switches had 4 states each: I could flip them up, down, or press them.
Sadly I am absolutely terrible with the soldering iron, so I broke 2 of my buttons wiring it up. I reluctantly ordered another 10 buttons - figuring that I might as well have a backlog - but they never showed up.

Then it hit me. Hey, I can just use my perfectly good touchpad- the one I have spent all this time getting rid of! This is that project.

This project aims to make a multitouch touchpad an alternate input device for the keyboard. The user keeps 4 fingers on the touchpad, and moves them up and down- the combination of up/down/middle maps to a key on the keyboard.
